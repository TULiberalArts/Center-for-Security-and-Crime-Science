## ProRanger Philadelphia

“ProRanger Philadelphia” is an academic and technical skills training and paid internship program that is cooperatively administered by the National Park Service and Temple University. The program was established to recruit, train and employ law enforcement park rangers for the National Park Service. Upon graduation from Temple University and successfully completing the ProRanger program, participants are placed in a permanent career tenure law enforcement park ranger position with the  National Park Service.

Upon acceptance into the ProRanger Philadelphia program, a ProRanger trainee will become part of a experiential learning cohort made up of between 12 and 20 fellow trainees. The cohort will annually enroll in a one credit course at Temple University that focuses on learning about the mission and functions of the National Park Service, the role of law enforcement in National Parks and the reflective National Park experiences of the cohort group.

During the non-academic summer periods between the freshmen/sophomore and sophomore/junior years, the ProRanger Philadelphia trainee will be assigned to a National Park area and will be employed as a seasonal National Park Service Park Ranger.

During the non-academic period between the junior/senior year, the ProRanger trainee will be enrolled in the 10 week Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program (SLETP) held at Temple University.

## Research Resources

### Mechanics Of Applying For External Funding Through Temple

In addition to Temple-sponsored funding for research, many faculty and students also apply for external research funding. Major sources for Criminal Justice funding include, but are not limited to the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Justice, and the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Please consult the websites of the specific agencies for current funding solicitations and deadlines.

The Criminal Justice Department’s Research Committee has put together a document to illuminate the process for applying here at Temple. Click [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/cj/files/2014/09/ExternalFundingGuide1.pdf) to view this document titled _‘Mechanics of Submitting a Grant Proposal for External Funding’_. This document should be viewed as a resource rather than the final word in how to apply.

### Human Subjects Approval

The Criminal Justice Department is committed to the highest ethical standards when conducting research involving human subjects. We follow the guidelines set out by Temple University and the federal government.

Click [here](http://research.temple.edu/irb) to visit the Temple Institutional Review Board home page.

Faculty in Criminal Justice endeavor to provide undergraduate students with ‘hands on’ class-related activities that often require them to do fieldwork or analyze data. Each faculty member is required to obtain approval from the IRB for these activities during the semester in which they are to be completed. The **IRB Approval Guide for Undergraduate Classroom Activities** document (under construction) provides details on the necessary paperwork to be filed by the faculty member. It also contains instructions for how undergraduate students should sign up and complete the undergraduate student version of the IRB training course.

**Caitlin Taylor, PhD (Temple) Assistant Professor, LaSalle University**__
Click [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/cj/files/2014/10/CJ_PODCASTS_CAITLIN_TAYLOR_bb1.mp3) to listen to the podcast titled: "_Family Support and the Successful Reentry of Formerly Incarcerated Individuals_"

Abstract: This PhD dissertation fills an important gap in the recidivism prediction literature by investigating the role of family support for individuals who have been deemed serious and violent offenders and recently released from state prisons.  As part of the evaluation of the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI), 1,697 adult males and 357 adult females were interviewed 30 days prior to their release and then three, nine and 15 months following release.  Using the data collected from these interviews, this dissertation explores the relationship between emotional family support and instrumental family support and four measures of re offending: any self-reported criminal offending, any self reported violent offending, any self-reported drug offending and whether any arrest occurred (using official records from the National Crime Information Center) during each of the post-release follow up periods.
Controlling for other known predictors of re offending, logistic regression models are used to predict the likelihood of re- offending. Considering respondent attrition over successive interview waves, all analyses are conducted using list wise deletion as well as multiple imputation to handle missing data.  Results generally reveal that emotional support is associated with a significant decrease in re-offending, while instrumental support is not significantly associated with re-offending. These findings have a variety of implications for correctional policies and programming, sentencing policies, post-release supervision policies and programming, criminological theory and future research.

**Evan Sorg, PhD student (Temple)**__
Click [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/cj/files/2014/10/cj_podcasts_evan_sorg_final_2012052211.mp3) to listen to the podcast titled: "_Community Level Impacts of Temperature on Urban StreetRobbery"_ 

Abstract: This study explores the community-level connections between street robbery and temperature. It examines whether community socioeconomic status (SES) and crime-relevant land uses strengthen or weaken the temperature impact. A theoretical framework relying on routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, and resident-based control dynamics organized predictions. Monthly street robbery counts and temperature data for 36 consecutive months were combined with census and land use data, and analyzed with multilevel models. Results suggest that community robbery counts were higher when temperatures were higher, and in lower SES communities. In support of previous work with property crime, but in contrast to previous work with assault, the effects of temperature were stronger in higher SES communities. In support of the integrated model, commercial land use prevalence and subway stations were associated with heightened temperature impacts on robbery.Community-level fixed and random effects of temperature persist when controlling for land use and community structure; further, the random effects depend in part on both. There are implications for understanding indigenous guardianship or informal resident-based place management dynamics, and for planning seasonal police deployments.

**Cory Haberman, Phd student (Temple)**__
Click [here](http://www.cla.temple.edu/cj/files/2014/09/coryrevised1.mp3) to listen to the podcast titled: _"The variable impacts of public housing community proximity on nearby street robberies"_

Abstract: Objectives: Use crime pattern theory to investigate the proximity effects of public housing communities on robbery crime while taking into account the presence of nearby nonresidential facilities.
Method: The study uses data describing 41 Philadelphia public housing communities and their surrounds. Surrounds are defined using two increments of street block-sized buffers. Multilevel models(buffer areas nested around public housing communities) allowing the proximity effect to vary across communities and predicting its shape with public housing level predictors are estimated.
Results: The multilevel models show that the shape of proximity effects varies across public housing communities and depends on community size, even after factoring in presence of nonresidential facilities. Spatially,multiple public housing communities close to one another have more intense robbery patterns.
Conclusions: Labeling all public housing communities as equally criminogenic robbery exporters is unwarranted. In fact, some communities have lower robbery counts than the areas surrounding them.Consequently, effectively addressing robbery in and around public housing communities will require careful consideration of where the problem is located. Locating public housing communities more than two blocks apart may reduce robbery.
