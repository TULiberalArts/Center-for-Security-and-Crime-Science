### Why Would You Do An Internship?

- Apply theoretical knowledge to real situations

- Make connections that will be useful for your career
- Create an opportunity that helps you decide what you want to do and what you don’t want to do when you leave Temple
- Receive on-the- job training
- Many students find that their internships turn into full-time employment after they graduate!

### What Should You Do Now?

Think ahead and select your courses with an internship in mind. If you are considering a placement within the next two semesters, begin to prepare a few months in advance, especially for sites that may do background checks (Federal Law Enforcement). Prepare a resume.

### If I Sighn Up For An Internship, What Does It Involove?

CJ 4087 is the actual internship/fieldwork. You complete 10, 20,or 30 hours of fieldwork per week and earn 3, 6 or 9 credits respectively. In addition to the work hours you put in, you will have a few academic requirements (e.g. readings, short papers) for the internship. You will receive a letter grade.
CJ 4077 is the required weekly Practicum class for which you receive 3 CJ elective credits. It is given a standard letter grade.

### Process For Internship Placement And Registration

- Choose an Internship Site: Meet with Dr. Cheryl Irons for guidance and suggestions in deciding on an internship placement. You will be provided with the name and phone number of the person to contact.
- Call the Site and arrange the interview.
- After you have had your interview and have been accepted by the site you will need to fill out an Internship Registration Form available in the Criminal Justice office, or from Dr. Irons. This form is then given to Dr. Irons for approval.

Contact Dr. Cheryl Irons to begin the process of selecting and registering for an internship: (267) 468-8281. E-mail is the most effective way to contact Dr. Irons: [cirons@temple.edu](mailto:cirons@temple.edu). **You can not register online for CJ4077 and CJ4087.**

- [Graduate Funding](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/index.htm)
- [Graduate Policies](http://www.temple.edu/grad/policies/index.htm)

### Financial Assistance

The Department of Criminal Justice ranks among the highest in the University in faculty and student involvement in local and national research activities. The result has been a steady stream of grant-funded employment positions that provide both financial support and the opportunity to develop research skills and graduate thesis/dissertation opportunities. The doctoral program is proud of its track record of support of our doctoral students through a combination of such positions and the other sources of financial support outlined below.

Financial support is available to many graduate students through a variety of University and Department teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and awards. Most assistantships and fellowships carry a stipend plus tuition waiver.

The PhD is a full-time endeavor.  It is our standard practice to limit admissions to the PhD program to the number of full-time students to whom we can commit funding support for a period of several years.  Beyond the guaranteed period of support, we are extremely proud of our track record and ability to fund doctoral students who are making timely progress toward the completion of their degrees.  Please note that no funding decisions can be made until after an applicant is officially admitted to the Ph.D. program. Applicants should also consult the Graduate School web pages for information on application deadlines and funding opportunities available university-wide.

Depending upon available resources, a Teaching Assistantship (TA) may be awarded either to incoming or matriculated doctoral students. If a Teaching Assistantship is awarded to an incoming student during the first year, (unless notified otherwise) the Department guarantees four years of funding from either a Teaching Assistantship position or an alternative research or support source, depending upon maintaining good academic standing. Students should be aware that good scores in the GRE examinations are one of the best predictors of availability of financial assistance.

Additional financial support is often provided by employment and training opportunities on externally funded faculty research projects. Positions on funded research projects may include full or partial tuition coverage in addition to salary for up to 20 hours per week during the semester, with the possibility of full-time employment during semester breaks and summer months. The timing and availability of such opportunities depend on the status of faculty research projects and external grants.

Funding opportunities for students in the MA program students are limited.  Masters students cannot be funded through Teaching Assistantships.  Occasionally, there are funded research opportunities for which MA students are eligible.

### Graduate Student Association

Welcome incoming and prospective students!

Choosing the appropriate graduate program can be stressful and overwhelming. We are here to provide information in the decision-making process. If you are interested in graduate studies in the Department, how to navigate administrative paperwork, or where to live and what to do in Philly feel free to contact a graduate student. We will do whatever we can to ease your transition into graduate studies in the Department of Criminal Justice.

The Criminal Justice Graduate Student Association (CJGSA) is an active group that sponsors academic and social events that facilitate both the professional development and social development of our members. The CJGSA is responsible for serving as a liaison between graduate students and faculty members, assisting undergraduate students in the development and refinement of their coursework through the department Mentoring Center, and offering support to incoming and prospective students by sharing information and perspectives on the program, graduate student life, and living in Philadelphia. In addition to these routine activities, the CJGSA invites critical thinkers to share their justice related ideas and experiences with Temple University and Philadelphia each spring. In 2013, this event was institutionalized as the Annual John S. Goldkamp Lecture with the intention of honoring Professor Goldkamp's innovative contributions to the field of Criminal Justice.
