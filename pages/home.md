The criminal justice system has three major components: the courts, law enforcement, and corrections. Our majors learn how these three components function and impact the larger society.

Students often debate issues such as policelegitimacy, victimsâ€™ rights, mass incarceration, fairness in sentencing, and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as a wide variety of other topics. Criminal Justice majors gain a deeper understanding of crime, governance and social justice. Our students graduate and make a difference by working in various criminal justice agencies, becoming attorneys and attending graduate school.
