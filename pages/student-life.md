## ProRanger Philadelphia
“ProRanger Philadelphia” is an academic and technical skills training and paid internship program that is cooperatively administered by the National Park Service and Temple University. The program was established to recruit, train and employ law enforcement park rangers for the National Park Service. Upon graduation from Temple University and successfully completing the ProRanger program, participants are placed in a permanent career tenure law enforcement park ranger position with the  National Park Service.

Upon acceptance into the ProRanger Philadelphia program, a ProRanger trainee will become part of a experiential learning cohort made up of between 12 and 20 fellow trainees. The cohort will annually enroll in a one credit course at Temple University that focuses on learning about the mission and functions of the National Park Service, the role of law enforcement in National Parks and the reflective National Park experiences of the cohort group.

During the non-academic summer periods between the freshmen/sophomore and sophomore/junior years, the ProRanger Philadelphia trainee will be assigned to a National Park area and will be employed as a seasonal National Park Service Park Ranger.

During the non-academic period between the junior/senior year, the ProRanger trainee will be enrolled in the 10 week Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program (SLETP) held at Temple University.

## The Inside-Out Prison-Exchange Program
The Inside-Out course is a special group independent study in which a small group of “outside” students has class with a group of “inside” students in the Philadelphia Prison System and Graterford Prison. The program is an opportunity for everyone involved to explore issues of crime and justice behind the walls,in the hopes of deepening and transforming the dialogue about these issues. Information on the Inside-Our Program can be found on the [Inside-Out website](http://www.insideoutcenter.org/). The program’s e-mail address is [inout@temple.edu](mailto:inout@temple.edu).

## Graduate Student Association

Welcome incoming and prospective students!

Choosing the appropriate graduate program can be stressful and overwhelming. We are here to provide information in the decision-making process. If you are interested in graduate studies in the Department, how to navigate administrative paperwork, or where to live and what to do in Philly feel free to contact a graduate student. We will do whatever we can to ease your transition into graduate studies in the Department of Criminal Justice.

The Criminal Justice Graduate Student Association (CJGSA) is an active group that sponsors academic and social events that facilitate both the professional development and social development of our members. The CJGSA is responsible for serving as a liaison between graduate students and faculty members, assisting undergraduate students in the development and refinement of their coursework through the department Mentoring Center, and offering support to incoming and prospective students by sharing information and perspectives on the program, graduate student life, and living in Philadelphia. In addition to these routine activities, the CJGSA invites critical thinkers to share their justice related ideas and experiences with Temple University and Philadelphia each spring. In 2013, this event was institutionalized as the Annual John S. Goldkamp Lecture with the intention of honoring Professor Goldkamp's innovative contributions to the field of Criminal Justice.

## Center for Security and Crime Science
The Center for Security and Crime Science (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University) is the first center in the United States devoted to Crime Science. In the 21st Century, thinking about crime has expanded in scope to move beyond domestic concerns and security has become more broadly construed as dealing with issues of public safety and social harm. Crime is now the business of private as well as public agencies, formal as well as informal entities, all seeking to address multiple levels of security concerns.

Crime Science is a departure from old ways of thinking about the problem of crime in society. Traditional criminology has concentrated on what happens after crimes are committed; that is, how we respond to a criminal act and how we define “crime”. Crime Science aims to get upstream of crime and to proactively prevent it rather than merely respond to it. Crime Science examines those crimes which occur most frequently and then develops policy options which close off the criminal opportunities. This approach can work to reduce both the inclination and the opportunity to commit crime and harm communities.

Crime Science takes the issue of crime one step further than traditional criminology. It seeks contributions from inter-related disciplines, including; psychology, geography, public health, law and urban planning. The inter-disciplinary nature of Crime Science allows the development of a coherent strategy to influence both product and building design, and to examine the social and psychological factors, which contribute to criminal activity. The result is an integrated approach to the problem of crime.
