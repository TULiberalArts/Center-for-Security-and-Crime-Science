## Mission And Goals

The mission of the Bachelor of Arts program in Criminal Justice is to foster a comprehensive understanding of the nature of crime and the effectiveness and fairness of society’s efforts to prevent and control it. Students engage in a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of crime, offenders, and victims, as well as the agencies, goals, laws, policies, and processes of the criminal justice system. Emphasis is upon promoting critical thinking about the kinds of questions and problems that shape developments in research, practice, policy and reform, and the skills utilized by scholars and professionals in the field.

Majoring in criminal justice helps to prepare students for careers as practitioners, researchers, and academics in a variety of public and private sector professions in both adult and juvenile systems of justice, at the federal, state, and local levels of government. It also provides the core liberal arts foundations for students interested in alternative career paths or advanced education in law school and graduate programs in criminal justice, criminology, and related social-science fields.

**Criminal Justice Honors Program**

The Department has its own Honors Program in which majors who are also University Honors students may tailor their honors experience to include a criminal justice specialization. In addition to the honors-level elective courses offered, an invaluable part of the program is the opportunity for students to develop an honors thesis based upon an undergraduate research project individually mentored by a criminal justice professor.

**Criminal Justice 4+1 BA/MA**

High-achieving undergraduates will be invited by the faculty of the Criminal Justice Department to apply for the BA/MA 5 year program.

Up to 9 credits of graduate work may count for both the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs; these are used as Criminal Justice major electives in the undergraduate degree. Eligible students have a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and will have completed 83 credits of their overall program by the time they are admitted to this program in the spring of their Junior year. Students must have completed the following courses to be considered for this program: CJ 1001, CJ 2401, CJ 2597 (formerly CJ 2601), and CJ 2602.

Eligible students will receive notification at the end of their Sophomore year, and applications will be accepted until October 7th of their Junior year.
