## A Hans-On Approach

Students have a wide variety of internship opportunities and our classes emphasize experiential learning. Our internationally recognized “Inside Out” program offers the opportunity to attend classes in a prison.

## Highly Qualified Faculty

Our faculty members have spent years working in the criminal justice field and bring their research and experience
into the classroom. They also bring a wide variety of contacts that translate into interesting guest speakers and networking opportunities with those who work in all facets of criminal justice.

## Networking Opportunities

Through our faculty’s contacts with practitioners in courts, corrections and policing, as well as via active involvement by undergraduates in internships and research activities, students are given excellent grounding for employment, law school or graduate school.
