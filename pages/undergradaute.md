## Highly Qualified Faculty

Our faculty members have spent years working in the criminal justice field and bring their research and experience
into the classroom. They also bring a wide variety of contacts that translate into interesting guest speakers and networking opportunities with those who work in all facets of criminal justice.

Through our faculty’s contacts with practitioners in courts, corrections and policing, as well as via active involvement by undergraduates in internships and research activities, students are given excellent grounding for employment, law school or graduate school.

## Mission And Goals

The mission of the Bachelor of Arts program in Criminal Justice is to foster a comprehensive understanding of the nature of crime and the effectiveness and fairness of society’s efforts to prevent and control it. Students engage in a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of crime, offenders, and victims, as well as the agencies, goals, laws, policies, and processes of the criminal justice system. Emphasis is upon promoting critical thinking about the kinds of questions and problems that shape developments in research, practice, policy and reform, and the skills utilized by scholars and professionals in the field.

Majoring in criminal justice helps to prepare students for careers as practitioners, researchers, and academics in a variety of public and private sector professions in both adult and juvenile systems of justice, at the federal, state, and local levels of government. It also provides the core liberal arts foundations for students interested in alternative career paths or advanced education in law school and graduate programs in criminal justice, criminology, and related social-science fields.
