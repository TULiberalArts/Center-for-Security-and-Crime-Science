  bio: "Professor Rosen came to the Department of Criminal Justice with a background in law teaching. After graduating from Temple University School of Law, she served as a law clerk to Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Samuel Roberts and worked as a civil litigator before returning to Temple to earn her LL.M. in Law Teaching. As a member of the Department of Criminal Justice faculty, her teaching and research interests have expanded beyond a narrow focus on Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure to a broader exploration of the intersection between the structure of legal doctrine and the criminal justice system, both today and in the past. She has written on topics ranging from battered women’s self-defense, the scope of the 4th amendment’s protection of the privacy of the contents of our bodies, and Jail law. More recent research focuses on reform of legal doctrine that enables racially disproportionate law enforcement and on exploration of how criminal justice research can be utilized to better inform legal decision-makers."

  expertise: "Organized crime, Policing, Terrorism, Transnational crime, Public sector police employment"
  bio: "My teaching at Temple University comes as a second career after spending nearly 30 years in law enforcement, the majority of which was spent in the federal government. I worked for over 27 years as a special agent in the U.S. Customs Service and its successor agency, the Department of Homeland Security. I conducted investigations into drug smuggling conspiracies, international money laundering, fraudulent entry of merchandise and export enforcement of critical technology and munitions laws. I also served as the Chief of State for the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, the international police organization, as a founding member of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, (FinCEN) and numerous liaison positions in the federal sector. I have been an instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, where I taught case development skills, managing undercover investigations and confidential source development. I have also taught export control courses in conjunction with the U.S. government’s national security and counter proliferation programs at various locations overseas. Since coming to Temple, I have been teaching organized crime, white collar crime, the law enforcement and criminal justice introductory courses as well as the writing intensive course in critical issues in law enforcement. I developed and taught a new course called Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Global Security. In addition, I conduct career-oriented workshops on résumé preparation, navigating the federal job market, and interviewing for federal sector jobs."

  expertise: "Criminal justice policy analysis, Inequality and social control, Simulation modeling, Incarceration, Adjudication and sentencing"
  bio: "My research focuses on issues of power, inequality, and (formal) social control. Combining theoretical and practical considerations, my work in the area of policy evaluation utilizes a realist framework. This research highlights the objectives of criminal justice policy reform as articulated by policymakers and compares the results with stated goals, while also considering of the public safety function of the criminal justice system and the responsibilities policymakers have to their constituents. In some of my work, I use simulation modeling to explore the consequences of reform from a systemic perspective, as well as more traditional quantitative and qualitative methods. I teach a variety of courses, including graduate and undergraduate statistics. My approach to teaching statistics is applied – while knowing how to calculate the number is important, advances in computing allow us to spend more time focusing on what the statistics mean and how to use them. I also teach courses on criminal justice policy, with an emphasis on the critical analysis and evaluation of these policies. Critical thinking and student participation in class discussions is an indispensable part of these courses. My goal is to get students to examine all sides of an issue, and hone the critical skills required to form their own conclusions."
