  bio: "Professor Rosen came to the Department of Criminal Justice with a background in law teaching. After graduating from Temple University School of Law, she served as a law clerk to Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Samuel Roberts and worked as a civil litigator before returning to Temple to earn her LL.M. in Law Teaching. As a member of the Department of Criminal Justice faculty, her teaching and research interests have expanded beyond a narrow focus on Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure to a broader exploration of the intersection between the structure of legal doctrine and the criminal justice system, both today and in the past. She has written on topics ranging from battered women’s self-defense, the scope of the 4th amendment’s protection of the privacy of the contents of our bodies, and Jail law. More recent research focuses on reform of legal doctrine that enables racially disproportionate law enforcement and on exploration of how criminal justice research can be utilized to better inform legal decision-makers."

  bio: "My teaching at Temple University comes as a second career after spending nearly 30 years in law enforcement, the majority of which was spent in the federal government. I worked for over 27 years as a special agent in the U.S. Customs Service and its successor agency, the Department of Homeland Security. I conducted investigations into drug smuggling conspiracies, international money laundering, fraudulent entry of merchandise and export enforcement of critical technology and munitions laws. I also served as the Chief of State for the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, the international police organization, as a founding member of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, (FinCEN) and numerous liaison positions in the federal sector. I have been an instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, where I taught case development skills, managing undercover investigations and confidential source development. I have also taught export control courses in conjunction with the U.S. government’s national security and counter proliferation programs at various locations overseas. Since coming to Temple, I have been teaching organized crime, white collar crime, the law enforcement and criminal justice introductory courses as well as the writing intensive course in critical issues in law enforcement. I developed and taught a new course called Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Global Security. In addition, I conduct career-oriented workshops on résumé preparation, navigating the federal job market, and interviewing for federal sector jobs."

  bio: "My research focuses on issues of power, inequality, and (formal) social control. Combining theoretical and practical considerations, my work in the area of policy evaluation utilizes a realist framework. This research highlights the objectives of criminal justice policy reform as articulated by policymakers and compares the results with stated goals, while also considering of the public safety function of the criminal justice system and the responsibilities policymakers have to their constituents. In some of my work, I use simulation modeling to explore the consequences of reform from a systemic perspective, as well as more traditional quantitative and qualitative methods. I teach a variety of courses, including graduate and undergraduate statistics. My approach to teaching statistics is applied – while knowing how to calculate the number is important, advances in computing allow us to spend more time focusing on what the statistics mean and how to use them. I also teach courses on criminal justice policy, with an emphasis on the critical analysis and evaluation of these policies. Critical thinking and student participation in class discussions is an indispensable part of these courses. My goal is to get students to examine all sides of an issue, and hone the critical skills required to form their own conclusions."

As you might imagine Elizabeth is no stranger to applied research. In fact she has spent the last twenty years applying geographic theory and methodology to the study of crime-related issues at both the local and national levels. At the local level, she institutionalized the use of geographic information systems (GIS) at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. At the national level, Dr. Groff ran the NIJ Crime Mapping Research Center from 2001-02 where she promoted the analytic use of mapping in criminal justice agencies. For the next five years she was a Senior Research Associate at the non-profit criminal justice research firm, Institute for Law and Justice where she conducted a variety of research initiatives including the development of an agent-based simulation model of robbery, the application of mobility triangles to understanding homicide, and an evaluation of efficiency, effectiveness, and enabling impacts of COPS MORE funding. As an early innovator in the use of GIS within law enforcement agencies, she has focused on developing evidence to improve police practice. Groff’s research has revealed which type of map communicates crime information without increasing fear (Groff, Kearley, Beatty, Couture, & Wartell, 2005), the efficacy of foot patrol for reducing violent crime if deployed at small, high crime places in sufficient strength (Ratcliffe, Taniguchi, Groff, & Wood, 2011), and that commanders are able to increase patrol at hot spots when they are provided with reports documenting the level of patrol achieved (Weisburd, Groff, Jones, Amendola and Cave, 2012). These important findings have natural implications for police practice and policy."

Related to this and illustrating his interest in implementation science, Dr. Hiller has studied organizational barriers related to improving the HIV/AIDS services continuum. Also, he has examined the effectiveness of organizational change interventions for this, as well as for improving the screening, assessment, and treatment referral processes for substance-abusing inmates in prisons and jails. Dr. Hiller has been a principal investigator on several funded projects, including evaluations of adult and juvenile drug courts in Kentucky and a DUI Court in Wisconsin. He has been a co-investigator on several high profile projects, including the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Study I and II (CJDATS I and II) and Juvenile Justice Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJTRIALS).

  bio: "Dr Jerry Ratcliffe is a Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University, Philadelphia, where he also directs the Center for Security and Crime Science. His career started as a cadet and then police officer with the Metropolitan Police in London (UK) where he served for a number of years on patrol duties, in an intelligence and information unit, and as a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group. Due to a severe winter mountaineering accident while ice climbing in the Scottish Highlands, he left the police after 11 years of service. He completed a B.Sc. with first class honors in Geography and GIS at the University of Nottingham (UK) and has a Ph.D. from the same institution. As a lecturer in policing based at the New South Wales Police College in Australia, he ran graduate programs in criminal intelligence and for a number of years coordinated Australia’s National Strategic Intelligence Course. Dr Ratcliffe was also a senior research analyst with the Australian Institute of Criminology, where he conducted one of the first evaluations of an intelligence-led policing operation. Since arriving in the US in 2003, he has twice been awarded the Professional Service Award for outstanding contributions to criminal intelligence analysis by the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts (IALEIA), and in 2010 he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Units (LEIU). He was the 2014 recipient of the Ronald V. Clarke ECCA award for fundamental contributions to the field of environmental criminology and crime analysis. He has published over 80 research articles and book chapters and five books including ‘Intelligence-Led Policing’ (2008 and 2016), ‘Strategic Thinking in Criminal Intelligence’ (2004 and 2009), ‘GIS and Crime Mapping’ (2005) and ‘Policing Illegal Drug Markets’ (2005). His studies have examined shooting in Philadelphia, drug markets and gang investigations in New Jersey, street gangs in Central America, and the impact of bars on nearby violent street crime. He was the lead researcher on the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment, a randomized study of the benefit of foot patrol in violent crime hotspots involving over 200 Philadelphia Police officers. It was awarded the 2010 IACP Excellence in Law Enforcement Research Award and the 2013 Academy of Experimental Criminology Award for Outstanding Experimental Field Trial. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and publishes and lectures on intelligence-led policing, and the role of mid-level commanders and crime reduction. His book (‘Intelligence-Led Policing’) has become the ‘seminal’ book on the subject and has bridged the academic/professional practitioner gap as both a text for university courses and as a promotion book for a number of police departments. It was recently translated into Chinese. He is an advisor to the Philadelphia Police Commissioner, and the first academic to be a research advisor with the criminal investigative division of the FBI. Outside of work, Jerry was an officer in the British Army reserves (Royal Engineers), has climbed the three highest mountains in Africa, led an expedition down the Selenga river in Siberia, and was the first non-Iban tribesman to successfully navigate (with a traditional carved boat) the rapids of the Temburong river in Borneo. He likes to scuba dive, fly his seaplane and drink single malt whisky…but not at the same time."

She is a recipient of the 2014-2015 Ford Foundation Fellowship Postdoctoral Award and a Visiting Scholar at the American Bar Foundation. Van Cleve received her Ph.D. in Sociology from Northwestern University where she was a legal studies fellow. Her work examines the cultural impact of mass incarceration on criminal justice apparatuses. She explores the contradictory ways that racial stigma is reproduced by these institutions in a purportedly, “colorblind” era. She received her B.A. and M.A. from Northwestern University where she was awarded the Farrel Grant for Public Policy and the Badesch Fellowship from the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. Nicole’s chapter, “Reinterpreting the Zealous Advocate: Multiple Intermediary Roles of the Criminal Defense Attorney” is in the book, Lawyers in Practice: Ethical Decision Making in Context (Leslie Levin and Lynn Mather eds., University of Chicago Press, 2011) and was the winner of the 2010 Outstanding Graduate Paper presented by the Sociology of Law Section of the American Sociological Association. Her current book entitled, Crook County: Racism and Injustice in America’s Criminal Courts is under contract with Stanford University Press and examines some of the classic questions about how our criminal courts function by engaging race as a central variable. She shows how color-blind legal institutions reproduce racial bias, systematically, and under the guise of procedural justice. Ultimately, her account reveals the courts as “the cultural engine” and crucial gateway for the racialization of criminal justice – where racism and discretion collide with dire effects to both the experience and appearance of justice. Prior to receiving her Ph.D., Van Cleve served in The Office of the Chief of Staff at the White House during the Clinton Administration and subsequently worked for five years as a Consumer Brand Planner for Leo Burnett, USA. She is the outgoing Research Director for Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice – a policy/nonprofit organization that specialized in legal advocacy. Van Cleve is the current co-chair of the Law and Society Association’s Collaborative Research Network on Critical Research on Race and the Law, a Junior Fellow of Yale University’s Urban Ethnography Project, and a member of the Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice Network (RDCJN)."

  bio: "Dr. Jeffrey T. Ward is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University. He received his B.S. in Physics and Psychology from Rutgers University and his M.A. and Ph.D. in Criminology, Law & Society from the University of Florida. He is past recipient of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Dissertation Fellow for his research exploring the consequences of justice system contact on developmental trajectories of violence using an integrated propensity score matching and latent class growth analysis method. Ward’s research takes two primary avenues including examining the short- and long-run causes and consequences of crime and life chances from a developmental and life-course lens and addressing fundamental measurement issues with criminological constructs. His substantive teaching interests include developmental and life-course criminology and criminological theory and his methodological teaching interests are wide ranging including research methods, item response theory, structural equation modeling, and counterfactual methods, to name a few."

  expertise: "Violence, Corrections, Substance Abuse Treatment, Organizational Change, Implementation Science"
  bio: "My research interests include violence, corrections, substance abuse treatment, and organizational change in both adult and juvenile settings. I am author of Counties in Court: Jail Overcrowding and Court-Ordered Reform (Temple University Press, 1995), Criminal Justice Policy and Planning, with Philip Harris (Elsevier, 2013, 4th Ed.), and Criminal Violence: Patterns, Causes and Prevention, co-authored with Marc Riedel (Oxford, 2015, 4th Ed.). I am currently Co-PI on JJ-TRIALS (Juvenile Justice – Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System), a national multi-site study (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2013-2017) to investigate and improve implementation of evidence practices for drug-involved youth in the juvenile system. I was Co-Investigator on CJ-DATS2 (Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Systems), a national, collaborative research project (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2009-14). Key research questions addressed organizational and systems issues related to implementation of effective drug treatment and other services in adult criminal justice settings. I was Lead Researcher for our research center on two of three multisite protocols: Medication Assisted Treatment Implementation in Community Correctional Environments (MATICCE), and the Organizational Process improvement intervention (OPII). I’ve been PI on several other large, multi-site research projects conducted as part of a long term research partnership with the PA Dept. of Corrections which began in 1998 and continues to the present. Funded projects include: “A Multi-Site Evaluation of Prison-Based Drug Treatment: A Research Partnership Between the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and Temple University” (Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency; 2005-08); “Evaluation of Drug Treatment Programs at the State Correctional Institution (SCI) at Chester: A Partnership Between the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Gaudenzia, Inc., and Temple University” (National Institute of Justice, 2002-06); “Evaluation of Prison based Drug Treatment in Pennsylvania: A Research Collaboration Between the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and the Center for Public Policy at Temple University” (National Institute of Justice, 2000-02); and “Building An Effective Research Collaboration Between the Center for Public Policy at Temple University and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections” (National Institute of Justice, 1998-2000). Other funded projects include “Building a Culture and Climate of Safety in Public Schools: School-Based Management and Violence Reduction in Philadelphia” (National Institute of Justice, (1993-95) and “Reducing Over-Representation of Minorities in the Juvenile Justice System” (Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency, 1994-96). Service to the community includes volunteer participation on the Philadelphia Mayor`s Reentry Task Force and the Philadelphia Children`s Round Table (chaired by the Philadelphia Family Court President). I also serve on the Editorial Advisory Board for the Prison Journal, the oldest, peer-reviewed journal publishing research on adult and juvenile confinement, treatment interventions, and alternative sanctions."

  bio: "Jennifer Wood earned a bachelor’s degree in Criminology at the University of Ottawa and received both an M.A. and Ph.D. in Criminology from the University of Toronto. Prior to joining Temple, she served as a Fellow for the Regulatory Institutions Network (RegNet) at the Australian National University. Jennifer is a criminologist with expertise in policing and regulation. Her work has explored how order and security is promoted by mixes of public and private entities including but well beyond the public police. Her book, Imagining Security (Willan, 2007; with Clifford Shearing), offers an account of ‘nodal governance’ as a means of explaining this plurality. She has published two co-edited books (Democracy, Society and the Governance of Security (Cambridge, 2006; with Benoit Dupont) and Fighting Crime Together: The Challenges of Policing and Security Networks (University of New South Wales Press, 2006; with Jenny Fleming)). Her current research examines the intersections between policing and public health.
